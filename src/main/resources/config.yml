gui:
  # Specifies if the background glass panes should be placed into the gui. If disabled things like crafting grids/slots won't be apparent anymore! Best in combination with custom gui textures!

  # If you use a database you can still load local data, but configure how it loads them with the following settings below.
  load: true
  # Specifies if the local storage should be loaded before or after the database.
  # This is useful if you have items/recipes that depend on items in the database or other way around.
  # Make sure that the dependencies of items and recipes are loaded in the correct order.
  before_database: true
  # Sets if already existing recipes/items with the same namespaced key should be replaced when registered.
  # Useful if you want to override a database recipe/item with the one from local storage.
  # Or when "before_database" enabled override local recipes/items with database data.
  # The recipes can only be replaced in Minecraft 1.15+, because the API pre 1.15 is unstable.

  # Specifies if it should print details about why the recipes are pending.

  # Usually not required as pending recipes not validated are marked as 'invalid' after a given timeout (see 'data.timeout.pending').
